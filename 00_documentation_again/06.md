### NOTES
"`Integer` and `Float` inheirt from `Numeric`. `Numeric` is basically the superclass of all numeric types, while `Math` is a module that supplies a lot of number cruching functionality."
"Starting with version 2.4.0, Ruby no longer uses `Fixnum` and `Bignum`; all integer values are `Integer` objects."
"In the version of `#step`'s calling signatures that we are interested, it takes two keyword arguments (a.k.a. named arguments): `:by` and `:to`. Keyword argument names are symbols."
