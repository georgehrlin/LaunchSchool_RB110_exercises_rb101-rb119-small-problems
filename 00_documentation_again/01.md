`File::path` "returns the string representation of the path."
```ruby
File.path("dev/null")           #=> "/dev/null"
File.path(Pathname.new("/tmp")) #=> "/tmp"
```
`File#path` "returns the pathname used to create file as a string."
```ruby
File.new("testfile").path             #=> "testfile"
File.new("/tmp/../tmp/xxx", "w").path #=> "/tmp/../tmp/xxx"
```

`File::path` is a class method, whereas `File#path` is an instance method.
I honestly dont know how exactly class methods are different from instance methods. From the code examples above, I gather that `File::path` is called on `File`, which is a class, whereas `File#path` is called on `File.new`, an object.

### NOTES
"Pay attention when reading the documentation; make sure you are using a class method when you need a class method, and an instance method when you need an instance method."
