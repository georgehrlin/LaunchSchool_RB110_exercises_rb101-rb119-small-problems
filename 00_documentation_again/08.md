```ruby
a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min(2) # Output: [3, 5]
```

### NOTES
"Some languages have a feature called multiple inheritance (a.k.a. MI). With MI, as it's often abbreviated, a class can inherit from two or more immediate superclass. Inheriting from multiple superclass, though, has pitfalls. **To avoid these pitfalls, Ruby doesn't allow MI.**"

"Ruby uses something like MI, but without the worse of the pitfalls. It is called mix-in modules, or more simply, mix-ins. Mix-ins provide a way for classes of different types to share behaviors without using inheritance."

"A class can use a mix-in module by using the `include` method. Once included, all the mix-in's methods become available to objects of the class."

"One of the most commonly used mix-ins in Ruby is the `Enumerable` module. It provides much of the functionality needed to iterate through collections such as `Array`, `Hash`, and `Range`."

"How do you know whether to look at the included Modules or Parent class for methods you can't find in the main documentation for a class? The truth is, there is no easy way to tell. You need to search both until you find the documentation you need."
