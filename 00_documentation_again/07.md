On the Ruby docs page for `Object#public_methods`, the method's signature is `public_methods(all=true) â†’ array`. Its description is: "Returns the list of public methods accessible to obj. If the all parameter is set to `false`, only those methods in the receiver will be listed." Therefore, to only print the public methods that are defined or overriden by the `String` class, simply pass in `false` as an argument: `puts s.public_methods.inspect`.

### NOTES
"Ruby is an object oriented language. Every value in Ruby is an object, which means that it has an associated class, and that class in turn has a superclass, or parent. Every class that inherits from a superclass also inheirts all of its methods."
"The `String` class inherits from `Object`, so every method in `Object` is also available in `String`, though perhaps in modified form."
"`Object#public_methods` takes an optional argument `all`. If that value is `true` or omitted, it returns a list of all public methods available to the object; if `all` is false, `#public_methods` limits the output to just those methods in the object that called `#public_methods`; for our purposes, this means just the methods defined directly in the `String` class."
"The phrase 'though perhaps in modified form' from above is there because class can override the members of its superclass. In fact, most of the Core and Standard Library API classes do just that. For example, `String` overrides `Object#==`. What this means is you must look at the documentation for your class before looking at the documentation for the superclass. Even if you know that the superclass has a particular method, you should always check that isn't being overriden by the subclass."
