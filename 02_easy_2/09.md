Q: What does this print out? Can you explain these results?

```ruby
name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name
```

A:
On line 1, `'Bob'` is assigned to `'name'`.
On line 2, the value `name` points to is assigned to `save_name`, so `"Bob"` is assigned to `save_name`.
On line 3, the destructive method `upcase!` is called on `name`, mutating the value of `name`, `"Bob"`, by capitalizing all of its letters to `"BOB"`. And because `save_name` points to the same object that `name` points to, `"BOB"` is also referenced by `save_name`.
On line 4, the method `puts` is called with arguments `name` and `save_name`. This outputs the following on console:
```
BOB
BOB
```
